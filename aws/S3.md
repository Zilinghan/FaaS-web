# Instruction: AWS S3 Bucket
This readme contains the instructions on how to create an AWS S3 bucket and store/access/update objects using AWS Python SDK (Boto3).

1. Create an AWS S3 Bucket with a unique name by following instructions from this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html).

2. Create a specific user with S3 read and write permissions in AWS IAM. This [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html) is a good reference on how to do this step. However, currently AWS does not give you the Access Key after creating the IAM user. You need to click on the user you created, then **Security credentials>>Create Access Key**. Download the access key as an .csv file and store it in a secure place in you local computer. **Note: This is the only time you can save and obtain the access key information**. If you forget to save it, you need to create a new one.

3. Install boto3 package.
    ```
    pip install boto3
    ```

4. Configure the access to the S3 bucket in your code as following: **(Recommended)**
    ```
    s3 = boto3.client(
        service_name='s3',
        region_name='us-east-1',
        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_KEY_ID',
        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
    )
    ```
    Alternatively, you can install `awscli` (AWS Command Line Interface), and enter necessary information. 
    ```
    pip install awscli
    aws configure
    ```

    **Note:** If you're running your Python script on an EC2 instance, you can assign an IAM role to the instance instead of using access keys. This way, the instance will automatically have the necessary permissions to access your S3 bucket.
